Hey,
I am gonna start next sem as new chapter of life, so I don't want anything which I want to tell someone and I haven't told.

1. I thank you for tallking with me for a month when I was initialy at Indore, Ofcourse conversation was way too boring but it helped me to adust there and more especially thankyou for ghosting me. If you haven't done that then I was never going to become who I am now and could never cleared JEE.

2. At one point, I did have a small crush on you. It’s nothing that affects anything now, but I didn’t want to carry any untold feelings into the future.


3. If you still want to be friend, we can continue our snap streak else you can block me from all the possible social media platforms.

Please don't judge me coz of this message. I know this might seem selfish, but it’s something I needed to do to start fresh chapter.
